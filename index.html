        <h1>Principal's message</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Dear Parents and Students

As the Principal of this esteemed institution with a well – respected legacy of providing exceptional opportunities to young minds since 2003 , I cordially welcome all of you to the new academic session 2020-21.

 

Success is always the result of continuous preparation dedication and diligence. Education is only a milestone in life journey and the youth have to face challenges before tasting the fruits of success with a positive, can-do attitude .With boundless enthusiasm, complete faith in the ultimate success and sustained effort you can surely and certainly accomplish your goal. Never have doubt about your ability. One does not become a celebrity or master overnight - you have to begin at the base of the mountain before you can climb its tallest peak. One can have several goals but the golden rule is to concentrate and to work upon one at a time. Make wise use of time.

 

Dear children, you all play Football , Basketball and many other sports but you also know that to win the match you have to practice every day for long hours. Maintain physical fitness, take proper rest, eat properly then practice again rigorously to achieve excellence. The school stresses on doing and developing. We are making systematic and determined efforts to bring the best to students under our care but you need to make efforts to derive benefit from the infrastructure, resources and teachers. Convert your efforts into success. Try to enter into good colleges. Become successful and carry the name of your school forward. Pursue your passion, try to discover yourself every day.

The Motto of your school is ‘Service before Self’. So, I urge you to try to devote some time in the service of society

 

Celebrate every bit of your journey of school life and come out victorious glowing with knowledge, life skills and confidence to achieve your dreams. We at DPS, Jaipur try to organize co –scholastic activities that are fun and thought provoking, to motivate you. I am a firm believer in the power of technology. Integrate it in your learning to gain access to resources leading to knowledge and becoming a global citizen. The most important areas of self - growth that you have to develop are discipline and significance of presentation.

 

It is not that you will not make mistakes but your self-confidence will always help you to realize your mistakes and keep you from repeating it. Prepare, practice and move ahead as always. I, on behalf of Delhi Public School, Jaipur pledge wholehearted support in your journey. On the path to realizing your chosen career goal, I urge you to study sincerely for your exams and achieve success for your family, friends, school and yourself.

 

No journey can be complete without the support of parents and teachers. Acknowledge them for the crucial role they play in your life. Begin now and get going. Decide what you want and go after it with all you have. Success is sure and certain.

 

Amidst cloud learning, flipped classrooms and virtual learning ; school still stands as a lighthouse of learning in terms of social relationships , expression , bonding and passing on the old  traditions of culture and love for children with a swelling changes. I hold on to my students and teachers with a mission to guide our students through academics, co scholastic activities, financial literacy, gender sensitization safety and security,  life skills, time management , career guidance and paving the way for entrance to centers of higher education and hoping them to become responsible adults.  Carrying on the better of human values and excellence in all spheres of life a tough job indeed but I thank esteemed members of management for bestowing in me the belief to carry on the journey and make an impact in the lives of young learners.

 

Today it is important that we are able to groom future ready learners who are equipped to adapt to changes in future. The role of the school is now to channelize the innate potential of every child by providing resources skills and information so that children can move ahead confidently.

 

I am confident enough that the Dipsites will make themselves stronger day by day, adding a new leaf to the grandeur of the school.

 I urge my students, “Find the leader within you.” Develop innovation , take initiative, become an entrepreneur rather than a job seeker.

Always remember four steps to achievement- Plan purposefully. Prepare powerfully. Proceed positively. Pursue persistently.

The future of the world is in my school today.

Wishing you a very positive attitude for success!

 

 

Rita P Taneja
